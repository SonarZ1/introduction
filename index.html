                       <h2>GEOGRAPHY</h2>
                       <p>Portugal is situated at the south-west point of Europe and also includes the Madeira and Azores archipelagos in the Atlantic Ocean.  
                        Mainland Portugal occupies an area of 88,889 km2. It is 218 km wide and 561 km long. It has 832 km of Atlantic 
                        coast and a 1,215 km border with Spain.</p>
                       <p>The Azores are situated in the Atlantic Ocean between Europe and North America. They have an area of 2,355 km2 and consist of nine islands 
                        - São Miguel and Santa Maria in the Eastern Group, Terceira, Graciosa, São Jorge, Pico and Faial in the Central Group and Flores and Corvo in the
                         Western Group. It takes about two hours to get from the Azores to mainland Portugal by plane</p>
                       <p>The Madeira Archipelago has an area of 741 km2 and lies in the Atlantic Ocean about 500 km from the African coast and 1,000 km from the European   
                        continent (1½ hours flying time from Lisbon). It consists of the islands of Madeira and Porto Santo and the uninhabited Desertas and Selvagens islands, which are nature reserves.</p>

                       <h2>CLIMATE</h2>
                       <h3><b>MAINLAND PORTUGAL</b></h3> 
                       <p>The climate in Portugal varies considerably from one region to another and is influenced by the relief, latitude and proximity to the sea, 
                        which offers mild winters, especially in the Algarve.</p>
                       <p>In the Porto e Norte area and Centro region, particularly inland, nearer Spain, the winters are colder, although the temperatures are 
                        still mild when compared to the rest of Europe. There is some snowfall. It occurs most in the Serra da Estrela mountains, where we find the 
                        highest point in mainland Portugal (1,991 m) and where it is sometimes possible to ski.</p> 
                       <p>The summers are hot and dry, especially in the inland areas (Trás-os-Montes in north-eastern Portugal and Alentejo). 
                        Temperatures are slightly lower in the coastal areas, because of the influence of the sea.</p> 
                       <p>There are often warm, sunny days in autumn. Nice weather at the beginning of November is often called "St. Martin’s Summer" as this saint’s 
                        day is on 11 November.</p> 
                        
                        <h2>POPULATION</h2>
                        <p>Portugal has a population of about 10 million. 
                            The population density is at its greatest in Lisbon, the capital and its suburbs, where about 1.9 million people live. 
                            The second largest city in Portugal is Oporto in the north. 
                            Generally speaking, there are more people living in the country’s coastal regions than in the inland areas.</p>
                        
                        <h2>RELIGION</h2>
                        <p>The majority of Portuguese are Catholics, but the Portuguese Constitution guarantees religious freedom and there are a number of different religions in Portugal.</p>
                        
                        <h2>LANGUAGE</h2>
                        <p>From a Latin root, Portuguese is spoken by about 250 million people in every continent, and is the 5th most spoken language in the world and the 3rd, if we only consider the European languages.</p>
                        <p>The Portuguese-speaking countries are scattered all over the world. Portuguese is spoken in Africa (Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique   and São Tomé e Príncipe), in South America (Brazil) and in Asia, (East Timor, the youngest nation in the world), and it is also the official language in Macao Special Administrative Region of China.</p>
                        <p>In Portugal there are lots of people who are able to communicate in English, French and Spanish.</p>
